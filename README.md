# Hello world, I am Sofia!


I am an italian master's degree student at University of Pisa who is passionate about front-end developing, graphic design, videomaking and photography.
I'm also interested in text encoding for the preservation of textual sources, in fact I've collaborated on a university research project for the preservation of unpublished testimonies of Lager survivors from the Second World War.
